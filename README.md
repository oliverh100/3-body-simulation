# 3-body-simulation

These python scripts were used to calculate simulations relating to the orbital resonance between Mimas (a moon of Saturn) and
a ring particle.

There was also resonance between Jupiter and a nearby asteroid.

These programs were used to numerically solve differential equations that were needed for the paper.
